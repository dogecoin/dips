Doggo Warden Statements
--

Such bad doggo may try to "dust" the network. This heckin "dust" boof prevents totally legit boops. Such wow value prevents effective dusting unless bad cataroni is actually a big doggo like Freedom Birdie Country.

Shibes who slow update may reject totally legit boops.

Zoomie shibes should much send big boop fee until 20-04-2020.
Much update ASAP. Accept such legit boop.
