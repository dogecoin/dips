==Abstract==

This DIP describes introduction and changes proposed in BOLTS #0 #1 #2 #3 and #5 to adapt them to be suitable for use with dogecoin-node.
Decisions made in BOLTS are Bitcoin-Lightning-specific, and changes and collaboration will be required to understand existing vs desired
future state. This brief should be read in combination with BOLTS summary <a href="https://github.com/lightning/bolts/" target"_blank">here.</a>

==Motivation==

DRC-20 deploy, mint, transfer and other inscription functions create a risk to the primary function of dogecoin as a medium of exchange. The community has 
the right to express their thoughts on this issue by creating a DIP in order to urge creation of a more friendly ecosystem for node operators and consumers while attempting to
address the issues associated with the limited function of DRC-20 marketplaces without implementing a complete re-write to PoS.

This DIP is meant to (re)introduce the concepts in the BOLTS above and to provide a mechanism for off-chain transfer of deployed DRC-20, dogemap and doge-dns inscriptions
in order to support at minimum 33X growth in daily transactions prior to next run on crypto and achieve goals outlined in the "10/10/100X problem".

== Speculative Impacts ==

To address the issues associated with transaction time and transaction cost presented by DRC-20 and avoid future impacts of potential "spikes" associated with DRC-20. 
To avoid necessity to consider PoS and face potential negative impacts to community sentiment and economic market disruption. To avoid the risks associated with a "lift and shift" migration
to PoS.

== Security Impacts ==

DRC-20 security is presently secured from counterfeiting via DRC-20 marketplace indexing and data sharing.
