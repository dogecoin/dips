==Abstract==

This DIP reduces changes the proof of work scheme to a less energy intensive method of governance.

Currently, cryptocurrency work uses a lot of energy; however there are methods of determining distributed consenus in a secure mannor using
less power. Effectively, by moving solving work on ASICs, GPUs, and CPUs and moving those to querying bits on a spinning disk,
overall energy consumption is reduced.

==Motivation==

Climate Chaos is unfolding around us. By taking direct action in changing the core of cryptocurrencies
to a more environmentally friendly method of work, we grant ourselves
some additional time to address this chaos.

==Protocol==

No finite protocol has been suggested. Proof of Space-Time suggestions are absolutely welcome.
